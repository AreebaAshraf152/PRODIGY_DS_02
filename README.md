# PRODIGY_DS_02
Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic dataset using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn in Google Colab. Includes data cleaning, handling missing values, and visualizations such as age distribution, gender counts, fare trends, and survival by gender. Upload CSV in Colab and run to explore insights.
# Titanic Data Analysis 🚢

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset. It handles missing values, cleans the data, and visualizes patterns such as age distribution, gender counts, fare trends, and survival by gender.

---

## 📂 Features
- Data Cleaning (handling missing values & duplicates)
- Age distribution plot
- Gender count visualization
- Scatter plot (Age vs Fare)
- Survival by gender (if available)

---

## 🛠 Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Google Colab

---

## ▶️ How the Code Works
1. **Upload Dataset**: The code asks you to upload a Titanic dataset CSV in Google Colab.  
2. **Data Exploration**: It displays dataset head, tail, summary statistics, and column info.  
3. **Missing Values Handling**:  
   - Drops rows where "Embarked" is missing.  
   - Fills missing "Cabin" values with `"Unknown"`.  
   - Replaces missing "Age" values with the mean age.  
4. **Duplicates Check**: Identifies and reports duplicate rows.  
5. **Visualizations**:  
   - **Age Distribution**: Histogram with KDE.  
   - **Gender Count**: Male vs Female distribution.  
   - **Scatter Plot**: Age vs Fare relationship.  
   - **Survival by Gender**: Survival counts based on gender (if "Survived" column exists).
